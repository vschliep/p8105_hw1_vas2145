``` r
data("early_january_weather")
  nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
  ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
  mean_temp <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
  mean_temp
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

Load the libraries and dataset. The `early_january_weather` dataset
contains 15 columns of 358 rows. Variables include the location the
temperature reading was taken (EWR), the time (including year, month,
day, hour), the temperature, and detailed weather conditions (humidity,
wind, precipitation, etc.) All recordings were taken in January of 2013.
The mean temperature of recordings is 39.5821229 degrees.

### Visualizing temperature as a function of time, coded by humidity

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather,
  aes(x= time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

\##Problem 2

\###Create a dataframe and sample

``` r
homework_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = rnorm(10) > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("level 1", "level 2", "level 3", "level 1", "level 2", "level 3", "level 1", "level 2", "level 3", "level 1")))
```
